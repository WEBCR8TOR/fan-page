          <p1 class="text-body">Roberto Clemente was born on August 18th, 1934 in Barrio San Antón, Carolina, Puerto Rico. He was the youngest of seven siblings and showed interest in baseball and athletics at an early age. In fact, by the time he was 17, he was playing for the Santurce Crabbers of the Puerto Rican Baseball League and 3 years later would be drafted by the Brooklyn Dodgers. While drafted by the Dodgers, Clemente would later get picked up by the Pittsburgh Pirates through the Rule 5 Draft following the 1954 season.</p1>
          <p2 class="text-body">The next 5 seasons would be a challenge for him as he fought through injuries and worked to overcome the language barrier. By 1960 however, something clicked with Clemente offensively and from that season on he would consistently be one of the MLB’s best hitters. He played only less than 124 games 4 times in his carrier and never played less than 102 games ever in his career. Out of his 18-year career, Clemente kept his batting average over .311 for 13 seasons and had a career batting average of .317. Roberto collected the 3,000 hit of his career at the end of the 1972 season and had amassed the below accomplishments as well.

          <p3 class="text-body">Roberto was always a well-known humanitarian and philanthropist in the off-season. Following the 1972 season he was dedicating himself to helping the relief effort in Nicaragua after a deadly earthquake ravaged the country on December 23rd, when unbelievable tragedy would strike. On New Year’s Eve, the plane he and 4 others were riding in, which was overloaded with supplies, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly after takeoff in Puerto Rico and there were no survivors. Roberto Clemente was just 38 years old. The news spread and not only devastated the communities of Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, Major League Baseball and the United States, but those around the world who were familiar with his story.

          <p4 class="text-body">The impact of his loss was memorialized when in 1973, Clemente became the first Latin American to be inducted into the Major League Hall of Fame. Shortly after, an award established in 1971 called the Commissioner’s Award, which is given to the player who “best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual’s contribution to his team” was renamed in Roberto’s honor and is given out until this day. He is regarded as one of the best, if not the best, right-fielder Major League Baseball has ever seen.
